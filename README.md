# Sorting Algorithms

ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the Sorting Algorithms repository! Here, I've implemented a collection of sorting algorithms in Python and Ruby, with ongoing work to implement them in C.

## Algorithms Implemented
- **Selection Sort**: Implemented in Python and Ruby
- **Bubble Sort**: Implemented in Python and Ruby
- **Insertion Sort**: Implemented in Python and Ruby
- **Merge Sort**: Implemented in Python and Ruby

## Assertion Tests
Each sorting algorithm has been rigorously tested using assertion tests to ensure accurate and efficient sorting.

## Future Work
ðŸš€ Currently working on implementing the sorting algorithms in C.

Feel free to explore the code and test the sorting algorithms! Contributions and feedback are always appreciated.
